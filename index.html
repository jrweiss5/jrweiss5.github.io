			<h3>Get to Know Me</h3>

			<p>Welcome! My name is Jocelyn Weiss and I am a junior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison majoring in Psychology with certificates in Criminal Justice and Theatre. Beyond my academic pursuits, I am an experienced writer, public speaker, and critical thinker passionate about destigmatizing mental health and developmental struggles by acting as a direct opponent of the stigma, being an ally to those who are affected, and studying to become a professional in the field of psychology.</p>

			<p>As a student, I continuously apply my passion for writing to my endeavors- whether it be for a class, <a href="https://belluwmadison.wordpress.com">Bell Magazine</a>, or creatively. I wholeheartedly believe in the power of words (written or spoken) to amplify voices that are overlooked or silenced, spark dialogue that can heal, and educate others about the validity and legitimacy of mental health, developmental concerns, and issues of social justice. Within my writing, I aim to embody inclusivity, awareness, and an ever-growing level of cultural competence. Looking toward my future, I know my writing will always be a unique way I can communicate with others, explore myself, and start conversations that are not had enough.</p>
